# Superstore Business Analysis

## Overview
* This project was produced to review the Superstore's operations and increase profitability. The important centers of profit and loss were identified, products that had an abnormal rate of return were concluded as well as the three best combinations of state and month of the year to advertise in. Recommendations were given for advertising based on the return on ad spend ratio.

* By analyzing sales data across different product categories, the Superstore can identify which areas contribute the most to its overall revenue. This insight helps to focus resources on high-performing areas and optimize its product offerings or services.
